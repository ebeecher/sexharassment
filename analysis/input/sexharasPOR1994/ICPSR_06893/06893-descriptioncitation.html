		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> This collection consists of three separate surveys
 undertaken to assess the extent of sexual harassment within the
 federal government. The records in each file contain responses to a
 mail survey on sexual harassment in the federal workplace from a
 disproportionately stratified sample. Each record contains reactions
 to a series of statements about the respondent's workplace, such as
 "I feel free to bring up general work-related concerns or suggestions
 to my immediate supervisor." Other data gathered include attitudes
 regarding sexual behavior that can happen at work, how the respondent
 defined sexual harassment, opinions on remedies that could reduce
 sexual harassment, descriptions of and actions taken in response to
 specific incidents of sexual harassment, and information about whether
 the respondent had been accused of sexually harassing others.
 Additional information includes respondent's work schedule, working
 hours, number of coworkers, number of supervisors, and gender of
 supervisors. Demographic variables include race, age, marital status,
sex, and level of education.</span></p>
