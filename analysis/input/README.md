# Input Directory

This directory should contain unedited data files directly from the source. I typically put different data sources into different sub-directories and include any relevant data documentation in the same directory. 

Following the guidelines of [Code and Data](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.xhtml#magicparlabel-270), this directory is dedicated to raw data from other sources ONLY. Datasets in this input directory should NEVER be edited. If newer data extracts are used, older raw data should just be replaced and changes commmitted. Constructed datasets should NEVER be placed in this directory. 


Main dataset:
United States Merit Systems Protection Board. Sexual Harassment in the Federal Workplace:  1978-1980, 1987, and 1994. Ann Arbor, MI: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research [distributor], 1997-09-26. https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR06893.v1

Summary about this dataset from ISPSR:
"This collection consists of three separate surveys undertaken to assess the extent of sexual harassment within the federal government. The records in each file contain responses to a mail survey on sexual harassment in the federal workplace from a disproportionately stratified sample. Each record contains reactions to a series of statements about the respondent's workplace, such as "I feel free to bring up general work-related concerns or suggestions to my immediate supervisor." Other data gathered include attitudes regarding sexual behavior that can happen at work, how the respondent defined sexual harassment, opinions on remedies that could reduce sexual harassment, descriptions of and actions taken in response to specific incidents of sexual harassment, and information about whether the respondent had been accused of sexually harassing others. Additional information includes respondent's work schedule, working hours, number of coworkers, number of supervisors, and gender of supervisors. Demographic variables include race, age, marital status, sex, and level of education."
